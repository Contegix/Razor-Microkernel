This project contains the Ruby scripts/classes that are used to
control the Razor Microkernel (and that interact with the Razor server).
The files contained in this project are bundled into the current version
of the Razor Microkernel (v0.1.5.0).  There are three primary services that
are included in this project that are started up during the Microkernel boot
process.  Those services include:

      1. The Configuration Agent, which can be found in the
         configuration-agent directory

      2. The Razor Microkernel Controller, which is actually contained
         in the rz_mk_control_server.rb file (which is, in turn, started
         up and controlled using the "Ruby Daemons" interface defined in
         the rz_mk_controller.rb file)

      3. The Razor Microkernel Web Server, which can be found in the
         rz_mk_web_server.rb file and which is used (along with the
         Configuration Agent) to push configuration changes from the
         Razor Server to the Razor Microkernel instances.

In addition, this project also includes a number of additional ruby files
and configuration files that are used by these services, a set of gems and
bundles that are installed dynamically each time that the Microkernel
boots (under the opt/gems and opt/bundles directories, respectively), a copy
of the 'bootlocal.sh' script (which is, again, under the opt directory in this
project), and the 'rz_mk_init.rb' script itself (which is used by that
bootlocal.sh script to start the appropriate Ruby-based services during the
Microkernel boot process).

Copies of the files that appear at the top-level of this project's directory
structure can be found in the /usr/local/bin directory of the Microkernel.
This project does not include all of the files that are needed to build a new
instance of the Microkernel ISO.  Instructions for building a new ISO
instance and the files needed to do so maintained elsewhere.  There are
also a number of extensions to the standard Tiny Core Linux ISO that are
bundled into the Razor Microkernel which are not included in this project.
Again, instructions for where to obtain these extensions and how to use them
to build your own Microkernel ISO are available elsewhere, and those files are
not included in this project.  We are in the process of determining how best to
keep copies of these additional files so that they are easily accessible from
this project, but there currently is no simple way to do so (since they
typically take the form of large binary objects, and Git doesn't deal too well
with large binary objects).

TO DO Items:

        1. Add ability to deal with multiple registration servers

        2. Add additional actions to the Microkernel Controller; may take
           the form of pluggable extensions that can be downloaded and
           dynamically loaded upon the receipt of an (authorized) command
           in the "checkin" reply...more to come on this
